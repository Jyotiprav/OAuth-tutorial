## Implementation of OAuth 2.0 using NodeJS

OAuth2 is an authentication protocol that is used to authenticate and authorize users in an application by using another service provider.

There are three parties in any OAuth flow:

The client - The person, or user who is logging in.
The consumer - The application that the client wants to log in to.(Our aplication)
The service provider - The external application through which the user authenticates. (which is gmail for this application)

In this project, we will authenticate using OAuth2 API, and build a sample node application, running on the local port 3000, with a web interface.
